  authorDescription: `I am a computer engineer from Sandnes, Norway. I have a bachelor degree in Computer Science (from the University of Stavanger), and I am currently working on a master's degree in Computer Science (due spring '20). <br /><br/> Computers has always been a hobby for me. Even though I am studying Computer Science, I am planning to major in Data Science, because I'm fascinated by how it can optimize desicion making and implement AI.<br /><br /> At the University of Stavanger we learned programming languages such as Java, Python, SQL, JS and MATLAB. <br /><br/>
    On my sparetime I went deeper into web programming and learned to use different frameworks such as Node, React, Angular and Gatsby (which I used for this website) <br /><br />
